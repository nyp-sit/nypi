        "The simplest form of linear regression (aka Simple Linear Regression) involves two variables where one variable is used to predict another. The assumption is that the two variables have a linear relationship. This can be expressed as an equation below, where we wish to predict y given a known value of x.\n",

        "Theorectically, for a linear relationship (straight line in a cartesian plane), we will only need 2 sets of (x, y) values (2 points) but in practise, due to noise and errors, we will usually need more. The usefulness of the equation depends on how well the values of $β_0$ and $β_1$ are chosen. That is of course possible only if we have sufficient and quality data from which to derive the best $β$ values.\n",
